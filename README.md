# Self-Driving Bot

The Self-Driving Bot project focuses on developing a sophisticated self-driving car simulation system utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence to enable clear and efficient navigation on roads. This simulation aims to mimic real-world driving scenarios, providing a platform to test and improve autonomous driving algorithms.

## Project Description

The project is developed using modern web technologies and tools. Key features of the project include:

- **Machine Learning and AI:** The core of the self-driving capabilities is powered by a machine learning model and AI algorithms, designed to process and interpret sensor data ( with rays ), make decisions, and control the vehicle.
- **TypeScript:** The entire codebase is written in Typescript
- **Simulation Environment:** A simulation environment is created to test and validate the self-driving algorithms.
